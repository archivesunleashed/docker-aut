## Attention

The `master` branch aligns with the `master` branch of [The Archives Unleashed Toolkit](https://github.com/archivesunleashed/aut). It can be unstable at times. Stable [branches](https://github.com/archivesunleashed/docker-aut/branches) are available for each [AUT release](https://github.com/archivesunleashed/aut/releases).

## Introduction

This is the Docker image for [Archives Unleashed Toolkit](https://github.com/archivesunleashed/aut). [AUT](https://github.com/archivesunleashed/aut) documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/archivesunleashed/aut-docs/tree/master/current). If you need a hand installing Docker, check out our [Docker Install Instructions](https://github.com/archivesunleashed/aut/wiki/Docker-Install), and if you want a quick tutorial, check out our [Toolkit Lesson](https://github.com/archivesunleashed/aut-docs/blob/master/current/toolkit-walkthrough.md).

The Archives Unleashed Toolkit is part of the broader [Archives Unleashed Project](http://archivesunleashed.org/).

## Requirements

Install the following dependencies:

1. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker)

## Use

### Docker Hub

Make sure that Docker is running. Run the following command to launch the Apache Spark shell with `aut` available:

`docker run --rm -it archivesunleashed/docker-aut`

If you want to mount your own data, replace `/path/to/your/data` in the following command with the directory where your ARC or WARC files are contained.

`docker run --rm -it -v "/path/to/your/data:/data" archivesunleashed/docker-aut`

You will be brought to a Spark shell. Skip ahead to the [example below](https://github.com/archivesunleashed/docker-aut#example).

### Locally

You can also build this Docker image locally with the following steps:

1. `git clone https://github.com/archivesunleashed/docker-aut.git`
2. `cd docker-aut`
3. `docker build -t aut .`
4. `docker run --rm -it aut`

### Overrides

You can add any Spark flags to the build if you need too.

```
docker run --rm -it archivesunleashed/docker-aut:latest /spark/bin/spark-shell --packages "io.archivesunleashed:aut:0.80.1-SNAPSHOT" --conf spark.network.timeout=100000000 --conf spark.executor.heartbeatInterval=6000s
```

### Spark Shell (Scala)

Once the build finishes, you should see:

```bash

```

When the image is running, you will be brought to the Spark Shell interface. Try running the following command.

Type

```
:paste
```

And then paste the following script in:

```scala
import io.archivesunleashed._

RecordLoader.loadArchives("/aut-resources/Sample-Data/*.gz", sc).webgraph().show(10)
```

Press Ctrl+D in order to execute the script. You should then see the following:

In this case, things are working! Try substituting your own data (mounted using the command above).

To quit Spark Shell, you can exit using <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd>.

### PySpark

It is also possible to start an interactive PySpark console. This requires specifying Python bindings and the `aut` package, both of which are included in the Docker image under `/aut/target`.

To lauch an interactive PySpark console:

```
docker run --rm -it archivesunleashed/docker-aut /spark/bin/pyspark --py-files /aut/target/aut.zip --jars /aut/target/aut-0.80.1-SNAPSHOT-fatjar.jar
```

Once the build finishes you should see:

```bash

For more information, see the [Archives Unleashed Toolkit with PySpark](https://github.com/archivesunleashed/aut#archives-unleashed-toolkit-with-pyspark) of the Toolkit README.

_Specifying Java/Scala packages with `--jars` will use local (inside the container) JAR files.
It is also possible to download these packages from maven central by specifying `--packages` instead of `--jars`._

_Note: downloading packages is taking a while and must be done every time the container starts;
using `--jars` is faster!_

```bash
$ docker run -it --rm archivesunleashed/docker-aut \
  /spark/bin/pyspark \
  --py-files /aut/target/aut.zip \
  --packages "io.archivesunleashed:aut:0.70" # Download Java/Scala packages from maven central
```

### Running Python Scripts through `spark-submit`

Using the Shell it is, for example, not possible to save a script and run it again, at a later time.
To run a Python script which exists in a separate file pass it to `spark-submit`, which is also part of the AUT Docker container.
Running a Python script through `spark-submit` requires modifications to `docker run` and the creation of a `SparkContext` and an `SQLContext` inside the script.

First, make sure your script imports and creates both a `SparkContext` and an `SQLContext`, as shown below.

```python
from pyspark import SparkContext, SQLContext   # required!
from aut import *

sc = SparkContext.getOrCreate()                # create SparkContext...
sqlContext = SQLContext(sc)                    # and SQLContext, based on SparkContext

# now use WebArchive as usual
WebArchive(sc, sqlContext, "/in").all() \      # process WARCs residing in /in, see below.
  .select("url") \
  .write.text("/out/result/")
```

The Python script to pass `spark-submit` exists outside the Docker container, the same holds for WARC files to be processed by that script;
finally, the results generated by the script must be retained after the Docker container exists and gets removed.
Therefore, it is required to bind several local directories to directories inside the Docker, supplying `-v` to `docker run`.
Using `-v`, a host file or directory (local machine) is bound to a container file or directory (inside the container).

On the local machine, it is assumed that the WARCs to process have been placed inside `in-local`, the script `process.py` has been put into `script-local` and the output generated is expected inside the directory `out-local`. _Note: the suffix `-local` has been appended for clarity, to distinguish host directories from container directories._

```
in-local
  archive1.warc.gz
  archive2.warc.gz
  archive3.warc.gz
out-local
  # (no output yet)
script-local
  process.py
```

With everything in place, submit the Python script to `spark-submit` with the following invocation of `docker run`. The host directories `in-local`, `out-local` and `script-local` will be mounted to the container directories `/in`, `/out` and `/script`, respectively.

```shell
docker run --rm -it \
       -v $(pwd)/in-local/:/in \
       -v $(pwd)/out-local/:/out \
       -v $(pwd)/script-local/:/script \
       archivesunleashed/docker-aut \
       /spark/bin/spark-submit \
       --driver-memory 4G \
       --py-files /aut/target/aut.zip \
       --jars /aut/target/aut-0.80.1-SNAPSHOT-fatjar.jar \
       /script/process.py
```

All flags after `/spark/bin/spark-submit` will be passed to Spark.
The `--driver-memory` flag is optional; when processing large amounts of data, it may be necessary to allow more memory to Spark. See [here](https://aut.docs.archivesunleashed.org/docs/aut-at-scale) for details.

Inside the script, which is running inside the container, the WARC files can be found in `/in`, results should be written into `/out` and the script itself resides in `/script`.

After executing the script, the results produced can be found inside `out-local`.

## Resources

This build also includes the [aut resources](https://github.com/archivesunleashed/aut-resources) repository, which contains NER libraries as well as sample data from the University of Toronto (located in `/aut-resources`).

The ARC and WARC file are drawn from the [Canadian Political Parties & Political Interest Groups Archive-It Collection](https://archive-it.org/collections/227), collected by the University of Toronto. We are grateful that they've provided this material to us.
